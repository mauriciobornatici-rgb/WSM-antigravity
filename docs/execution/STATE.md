# Execution State Snapshot

Last updated: 2026-02-18
Status: IN_PROGRESS
Current block: P2
Current task: P2.5 - Decomposition pass on oversized pages (Inventory started)

## Resume From Here
1. Continue P2.5 decomposition on remaining high-complexity pages (`POS`, `Invoices`) keeping behavior parity.
2. Continue P2.6 locale/wording normalization (Spanish AR) in remaining pages/components not covered yet.
3. Evaluar deduplicacion de toasts de error global/local en React Query para evitar mensajes duplicados en futuros handlers.
4. Keep P2 changes incremental and verify lint/typecheck/build on each batch.

## Completed
- Consolidated gap list and priority order.
- Created persistent execution docs:
  - `docs/execution/MASTER_PLAN.md`
  - `docs/execution/STATE.md`
  - `docs/execution/CHANGELOG_EXECUTION.md`
- P0.1 completed:
  - Removed vulnerable `window.open + document.write` print flow in:
    - `packages/client/src/pages/ReturnsAndWarranties.tsx`
  - Replaced with safe JSX-rendered printable area + `window.print`.
  - Verified no `document.write`/`window.open` usage remains in frontend.
- P0.2 completed:
  - Implemented atomic stock check and deduction during order creation in:
    - `packages/server/services/sales.service.js`
  - Added row-level lock (`FOR UPDATE`) and transactional inventory decrement.
  - Added inventory movement logging for sales deductions.
  - Aligned frontend messages with backend stock behavior in:
    - `packages/client/src/pages/Orders.tsx`
- P0.3 partial progress:
  - `GET /api/products` now returns `stock_current` derived from `inventory` (canonical read path):
    - `packages/server/services/inventory.service.js`
    - `packages/server/controllers/inventoryController.js`
- P0.3 completed:
  - Frontend stock reads aligned with canonical `stock_current` from `/api/products`:
    - `packages/client/src/pages/POS.tsx`
    - `packages/client/src/pages/Inventory.tsx`
  - Product type updated to reflect backend contract:
    - `packages/client/src/types/index.ts`
  - Inventory service response normalized to avoid leaking helper fields:
    - `packages/server/services/inventory.service.js`
- P0.5 completed:
  - Server startup now waits for DB initialization before listening:
    - `packages/server/index.js`
- P0.7 completed:
  - MySQL TLS toggle added (`DB_SSL`, `DB_SSL_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED`):
    - `packages/server/config/db.js`
    - `.env.example`
- P0.4 completed:
  - Added deterministic base migration covering runtime-required tables:
    - `packages/server/migrations/000_create_core_schema.sql`
  - Refactored DB init to migration-first bootstrap + deterministic seeding only:
    - `packages/server/config/initDb.js`
  - Converted schema reference to migrations-first policy:
    - `packages/server/db/schema/schema.sql`

    - `packages/server/middleware/errorMiddleware.js`
  - Documented explicit non-dev override and env profiles:
    - `.env.example`
- P0.8 completed:
  - Enforced invoice payment invariants in sales service:
    - `payment_status` now derived from effective payments (`pending|partial|paid`).
    - rejects overpayment (`PAYMENTS_EXCEED_TOTAL`).
    - prevents invalid payment lines.
  - Added accounting trace for invoice collections:
    - each payment line writes to `transactions` (`type='sale'`).
  - Synced order payment state with invoice state:
    - `orders.payment_status` no longer hardcoded to `paid`.
    - `orders.status` only escalates to `completed` when payment is fully paid.
  - Files:
    - `packages/server/services/sales.service.js`

    - `npm -w @wsm/client exec -- tsc --noEmit`
    - `npm -w @wsm/client run build`
- Incident hotfix (staging availability):
  - Root cause:
    - global `/api` rate-limit too aggressive for real navigation in staging (`100` req/15m),
      causing broad `429 too_many_requests` and empty screens.
  - Mitigation:
    - rate limits now configurable via env
    - safer defaults by environment (dev/staging higher, production controlled)
    - `/api/health` excluded from limiter
    - login limiter preserved separately and configurable
  - Files:
    - `packages/server/index.js`
    - `packages/server/config/env.js`
    - `.env.example`
  - Validation:
    - server syntax checks + frontend typecheck/build passed.

## Next After Current Task
P2.5 continuation - decompose another high-complexity operational page with behavior parity.

## Open Decisions (Need confirmation for upcoming blocks)
1. Stock policy (implemented assumption):
   - Applied Option A: deduct at order creation.
   - If business prefers reservation model, refactor in a dedicated pass.
2. Stock source of truth (resolved):
   - Canonical source: `inventory` table.
   - Compatibility contract: `/api/products` exposes derived `stock_current`.
3. Non-dev exception policy:
   - `ALLOW_INSECURE_NON_DEV=true` remains available as explicit break-glass override.
   - Default policy is strict fail-fast in staging/production.
